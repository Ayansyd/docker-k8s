#Kubernetes Deployment for Web Application and MongoDB
This README provides instructions to deploy a web application and a MongoDB instance using Kubernetes. The deployment includes ConfigMap and Secret configurations for environment variables.
------------------------------------------------------------------
#Prerequisites
Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or any other Kubernetes setup)
kubectl command-line tool configured to interact with the cluster
Files
mongo-config.yaml: ConfigMap for MongoDB connection URL
mongo-secret.yaml: Secret for MongoDB credentials
mongo-deployment.yaml: Deployment and Service for MongoDB
webapp-deployment.yaml: Deployment and Service for the web application which contains a web app as a docker image


#commands to execute the K8s-cluster

checks is the cluster is active:

minicube status

if not active the start the kluster:

minicube start

Then follow deploy each services in this specific order:

kubectl apply -f mongo-config.yaml


kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml


kubectl apply -f mongo-deployment.yaml


kubectl apply -f webapp-deployment.yaml


#check is the pods are created 
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
Accessing the Web Application
Once the deployments are up and running, you can access the web application using the NodePort specified in the webapp-service. If using Minikube, you can get the Minikube IP and access the application at http://<MinikubeIP>:30000.

#to get the minikube ip
minikube ip
if the Minikube IP is 192.168.99.100, you can access the application at http://192.168.99.100:30000.
